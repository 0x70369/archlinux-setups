# archlinux-setups

This repository is a collection of configuration files for various things in my personal Arch Linux installations.
It is meant to be used alongside my installation guides, stored at [my personal ArchWiki page.](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:0xMrRobot)

You are free to use them, but keep in mind that you may need to adapt them to your needs.

Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
